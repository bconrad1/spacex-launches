### SpaceX Launch Viewer

# Overview

This is a simple project meant to play around with Node/React. It pulls from the public SpaceX API https://api.spacexdata.com

Sorted by most recent launch, the page contains a card for each flight which shows the most important flight info and a link to each launch video.
